                      <p>Fleas are small, wingless parasites that infest the hair coats of mammals with their piercing mouthparts, that they insert into the skin of their host to feed on blood. Though they do not directly pose a risk to humans, the population of fleas should be controlled whether it be at a home or office. Worldwide there are more than 2400 species of fleas but in Melbourne, the major species of fleas found are the cat flea, dog flea and human flea.</p>
                      <p>Fleas are mainly transmitted from your pets so if your pet is constantly scratching any part of their body, you should immediately check for any flea bites and start flea treatment service. Before contacting a flea removal service, you should know what type of flea is infesting your property. This makes it really easier for you to explain the extent of the problem you’re facing. Don’t worry if you can’t identify the species, because that is what we as a flea treatment service professional are here for.</p>
                      <p>Although fleas don’t bring serious problems to humans, it can be fatal for your pets which in turn will let down your emotional mood. A wildly flea-infested area could bring extreme anxiety and worries which will ultimately affect your lifestyle. Flea infestation causes a number of health issue in pets, and flea removal and control are a necessity for home and office in Melbourne.</p>

                      <br>
                      <p>Fleas are among the worst parasites that attacks you and your pet. Flea bites can be nasty which is why flea treatment service is a necessity. Fleas are a serious threat to the health of your beloved cats and dogs because they are practically inseparable once they’ve latched on. Beside causing dermatitis in your pets, fleas can even transmit tapeworms. For fleas, breeding doesn’t take too much time. Flea lay eggs directly on the host but often the eggs fall off and the infestation is spread to the surrounding environment. Before you know it, you’ll have a total flea infestation on your property, so you should seek flea treatment service at all cost.</p> 
                      <p>Fleas seek the blood of the host to survive and the effects of their bites can range from minor irritation to deadly condition for the pets. If the flea removal is not done in time, then the increasing number of fleas can create skin irritation to humans. Also, fleas are carriers of bacteria that can cause constant scratching in humans.</p>
                      <p>Since Melbourne is an area with high humidity and moderate temperatures, it is a hotspot for fleas to live in. If you’re a resident of Melbourne, you already know this that you have high exposure and risks to fleas compared to other areas. In rare cases, fleas can bite humans and humans don’t react well to the bites. If the flea treatment service is not done, then people may experience swelling in their legs, faces and hands.</p>
