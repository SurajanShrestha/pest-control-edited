                        <p>
                            Many homeowners have flood, storms, fire and landslides on their list, but what most people forget are the tiny creatures known as termites, which bring up just as much damage. Termites are eusocial insects that have six legs, an antennae and wings, and are almost an inch in size. There are about 258 species of termites in Melbourne and all over Australia, however, some of the major species include the Rhinotermitidae, Termitidae, Mastotermitidae and Termopsidae.</p>
                            <p>
                                Termites form large colonies and eat away all the physical structures at your home and office. A colony of termites can be dangerous and really powerful. In nature, termites break down old trees in forests to make room for a new tree to blossom. However, if termites get into your property, they can cause physical, financial and also health damage. Also, termites are the reason for millions of dollars worth of damage to homes and structures throughout Melbourne every year. A colony of termites in your home/office means widespread structural damage. These pests feed on internal structures like beams, posts and wall supports. They enter a home from the ground up, generally through the foundation. A very large colony of these pests can likely create cracks in the foundation of the structure, causing consequential damage.

                        </div>

                                Areas where moisture is prominent attract termites first. So, if you’re looking for termites in your home or office, you must check your bathrooms first. Termites will create loose tiles, sagging ceilings and puncture holes in the drywall. These cause significant physical and financial damage to your structure. Apart from the physical and financial damage, termites also create health risks but are not a direct threat to humans. When a colony of termites move through your home, it accumulates dust and wood particles into the air which can cause allergic reactions and even asthma attacks to some.

                            <p>Termites can be a problem throughout the year in Melbourne, in which they will have caused significant damage.

The termite damage can be widespread, weakening the furniture and structures from inside. Imagine a supporting beam that gets weakened by the termites, your whole property could be warped. Once this kind of damage has begun it’s really hard to fix it so, termite removal from your home or office is necessary. Not having termite control leaves your structure completely unprotected from one of its biggest threats.</p>

It may seem frustrating to have to pay for termite control done on your property but what is more frustrating is that you find out that termites have been eating up your structures for years.
